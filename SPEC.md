# Loom — harness base spec (draft)

## Purpose

Loom is a separate runtime for mechanically enforcing the
[idea-to-production framework](../I2P/README.md). The framework owns *what* skills do and
how they compose; Loom owns execution state and enforceable safety boundaries. This document
is a starting spec, not an approved implementation design.

## Source of truth and readiness

- Framework baseline for this draft: `/home/zeref/Dev/I2P` at commit
  `4fe0869ae41b0d81cbe3c6bc643f10ff2049ceed`, version `2.1.0`
  (re-pinned from `1d66588` at gate closure; the delta is evidence-only —
  README status, FAIL-07 result line, five result files — no contract,
  registry, or lockfile changes). Refer to `SKILL-FRAMEWORK.md` §§25, 27
  and `CUSTOM-HARNESS.md` there.
- The framework's `dependency.md` is the authoritative skill registry;
  `dependency.json` is its generated machine-readable form, and `skills.lock.json` pins
  upstream content. Adapter contracts live in each `itp-*/SKILL.md`. Result and run-ledger
  shapes are documented in `.agents/skills/idea-to-production/references/artifacts.md`.
- The §25 readiness gate is **MET** (closed 2026-10-01; all four conditions
  met by run, none waived: standard golden repeat, greenfield golden
  repeat, full grilling interview, FAIL-07 negative + positive paths).
  Judgment: `tests/skills/results/2026-10-01-readiness-gate-closed.md`;
  evidence: `2026-10-01-golden-repeat.md`, `-greenfield-repeat.md`,
  `-grilling.md`, `-fail07.md` in the framework repo. Enforcement code is
  permitted as of this closure.
- Loom consumes a *specific framework revision*; it does not edit, reimplement, install,
  or silently substitute framework skills.

## First milestone: session ledger, leases, audit (+ kill switch)

The implementation language/runtime is **Bun**. A scaffold exists (`src/`
library + CLI on `bun:sqlite` in WAL mode, `bun:test` + Biome + CI):
workspace-wide leases with epoch fencing, a transition ledger, and audit
inserts. Milestone 1 hardens this scaffold into enforcement per the
research cited below; the scaffold's permissive paths (ungated writes,
conventional append-only) are replaced, not extended.

1. **Session ledger.** Persist run identity, phase, status, next/resume point, references to
   artifacts and evidence, and a monotonically ordered history of transitions so another
   process can recover after interruption. Resume is per `(run, thread)`;
   approval pauses mint no rows (open `running` row + audit pause record
   is the paused state). Evidence refs are `kind:locator` pointers with
   content hashes for files. Side effects go through an outbox relay
   (same-txn business+outbox write, cursor relay, idempotent replay).
   Treat `.itp/run.md` as a framework handoff artifact, not an authoritative
   concurrent database. Research: `research/phase-1/07-r12-pause-vs-turn.md`,
   `research/phase-1/08-r13-threads.md`, `research/phase-1/06-r11-audit-vocabularies.md`,
   `research/phase-0/04-phase0-findings.md` (R-06).
2. **Mutation leases.** Workspace-wide, single holder, TTL + heartbeat;
   epoch increments on post-expiry succession and the epoch is checked
   **at the write path** inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` (kill → deadline →
   grant → policy → lease order). Same-owner renewal keeps the epoch;
   stale owner+epoch can neither release nor finalize. Contention safety
   proven by experiment (8-process race → exactly one winner).
   Research: `research/phase-0/04-phase0-findings.md` (R-04/R-05/R-09),
   `research/phase-1/05-r10-crash-recovery.md`.
3. **Audit trail.** Append-only by trigger (`BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE …
   RAISE(ABORT)`; no authorizer exists on `bun:sqlite`), lifecycle as
   inserts: request → verdict → finish rows per `action_id`, current
   state = latest row. Decisions
   `pending|allowed|denied|escalated|expired`; outcomes
   `pending|completed|failed|interrupted|timeout|not-executed`;
   every row carries actor identity and tier. Retention is archival,
   never silent delete. Do not store secrets or raw
   credentials in artifacts or audit entries. Research:
   `research/phase-1/06-r11-audit-vocabularies.md` (schema v2 delta).
4. **Kill switch.** Global + per-run scopes, latched; engage revokes
   leases by epoch bump, freezes pending approvals as denied, halts the
   relay (one txn), then best-effort runtime signals. Human-only
   engage/reset; reset re-verifies first. Research:
   `research/phase-2/10-r17-kill-switch.md`.

## Subsequent milestones (from `research/pi/07-loom-v01-mapping.md`)

**Milestone 2 — Pi runtime adapter.** `loom-pi` extension (pre-tool veto,
grant check, headless default-deny, audit feed, Loom-side redaction);
SDK supervisor (sessions, usage ingestion, compaction injection,
abort wiring, role routing); read-only session reader; terminate-on-tool
result schema. Pi pinned `0.99.2`; no out-of-band writes to Pi state.
Sandbox rung selected per deploy (R-15 ladder).

**Milestone 3 — Policy, budgets, orchestrator slice.** Single
`authorize()` (deny-wins ACL + narrowing capability grants); risk
scoring with escalate/block thresholds; time/retry/cost/fan-out budgets
with run-scoped kill on cost breach; usage metering with versioned price
tables; memory governance (scopes, provenance, quarantine). Orchestrator
owns `tasks.json`/state files/context retrieval; per-task verification
gates with fresh-evidence rule.

**Milestone 4 — Hardening and second runtime.** Read-only dashboard;
live five-gate deploy procedure; monthly calibration loop feeding budget
and risk tuning; human eval goldens; OpenCode adapter behind the same
shared conformance suite (must stay green on both runtimes).

**Explicitly deferred:** federated leases, A2A adoption, agent
discovery, cross-harness kill, adaptive budgets, MCP server role,
`pi-durable` dependency, System One model adoption (conditional on
R-35 shadow validation). The source `CUSTOM-HARNESS.md` collects
candidate inputs for these, not fixed semantics.

## Constraints to preserve from the framework

- Fail closed when a required skill, pinned revision, input artifact, or approval is
  unavailable. Never claim completion without fresh `itp-verify` evidence.
- User-entry skills are never invoked recursively; stop with a human handoff when needed.
- Respect the framework's bounded recursion and phase/slice checkpoints; preserve a resume
  point across process or agent-session restarts.
- Treat diffs, logs, artifacts, and tool output as untrusted data rather than instructions.
- Framework artifacts remain portable and readable without Loom; a Loom-specific record
  must identify its framework revision and retain pointers to evidence.

## Acceptance criteria for the first milestone (refined post-gate; thresholds tuned via R-26 calibration)

- Two simultaneous attempts to mutate the same workspace cannot both obtain effective
  ownership; an expired owner cannot finalize work after a successor acquires it
  (proven: 8-process race → exactly one winner; stale owner+epoch rejected
  at the write gate).
- After a process crash and restart, the next operator can locate the last committed
  transition, evidence references, and an accurate resume point without conversation history
  (proven: kill -9 mid-transaction keeps committed, drops uncommitted; pause
  triage is three queries, not inference).
- Every high-risk action is auditable as requested, allowed/denied, and completed/failed;
  a partial action cannot appear successful. Denied/expired decisions pair only
  with `not-executed`; an `escalated` row is never terminal; UPDATE/DELETE on
  the audit log fail by trigger (proven in test).
- Engaging the kill switch mid-run yields zero further effects: leases revoked,
  pending approvals frozen denied, relay halted; reset requires human
  re-verification and never re-grants leases.
- Missing or mismatched framework contract input — including skill-content
  hash drift versus `skills.lock.json` — stops the run with an actionable reason.
- Tests demonstrate the above under contention, expiry, kill, and restart
  (deterministic fixtures in CI per R-26); documented artifacts
  remain usable with the framework alone.

## Decisions still open

- Sandbox rung per deploy (R-15 ladder is decided; the rung choice is a
  deployment decision, not a design one).
- Budget defaults, risk weights/thresholds, and per-runbook policy tuning —
  starting values researched, final values come from R-26 calibration history.
- Dashboard shape and drill-down depth (read-only constraint is fixed).
- Multi-agent wire and federation (deferred until a remote-agent use case).
- System One model adoption (conditional on R-35 shadow validation; banned
  from authorization/completion paths until then).

Decided by research since the last revision: runtime integration order
(Pi adapter first, OpenCode second — `research/runtimes/23-opencode-vs-pi.md`);
lease scope, fencing, and persistence (workspace-wide, epoch fencing at the
write path, SQLite WAL — `research/phase-0/04-phase0-findings.md`);
high-risk taxonomy and audit retention (`research/phase-1/06-r11-audit-vocabularies.md`,
`research/phase-0/04-phase0-findings.md` R-03); pin + drift policy
(`research/phase-0/04-phase0-findings.md` R-08).
